I love this song and I wanna write about it. I'm headin on over to ilovethissong to write about it.

This project is meant to give me a project with a real backend and prove that I can make something like that.

The frontend is located in the client folder and is built in React JS and SCSS.
The backend is located in the server folder and is built in TypeScript.
The two communicate using Axios.

The songs themselves are retrieved using the Spotify developer API. If there is no search result that is an exact match of the
artist and name entered, the song is not linked.
